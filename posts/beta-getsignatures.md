# Beta: GetSignatures.org

[GetSignatures.org](https://getsignatures.org) is a DocuSign alternative. It's in beta.

## How It Works

Upload a document. Add signature fields. Send it. Recipients sign. You get the signed PDF.

## Free During Beta

Request free usage in your profile. We'll grant it.

In exchange, we ask one thing: if something breaks, send us the error message and a screenshot. That's it. Help us find the bugs.

## Why We're Building This

DocuSign works. It's also expensive and slow. We think document signing can be simpler.
