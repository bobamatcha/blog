# Announcing PDFJoin

You're on a plane. No wifi. You need to merge two PDFs before landing. With most tools, you're stuck.

Not with [PDFJoin.org](https://pdfjoin.org).

## Your PDFs Never Leave Your Device

Drop your PDFs in. They never leave your device. No upload. No waiting. The merge happens instantly on your machine.

## Privacy by Design

Most tools ask you to trust their privacy policy. PDFJoin doesn't need trust. Your files can't reach us. There's no cloud to receive them.

Privacy by architecture, not policy.

## Try It Now

Try it: [PDFJoin.org](https://pdfjoin.org). No account. No signup.
