# Announcing PDFJoin.org: Free PDF Merging & Splitting, Forever

We're excited to announce [PDFJoin.org](https://pdfjoin.org)—a completely free tool for merging and splitting PDF files that will remain free for public use indefinitely.

## Your PDFs Never Leave Your Device

Here's what makes PDFJoin different from every other PDF tool out there: **your files never touch our servers**. Not during upload. Not during processing. Not ever.

When you drag your PDFs into PDFJoin, they stay right where they belong—on your device. The entire merging process happens locally in your browser using WebAssembly. There's no upload progress bar because there's nothing to upload. There's no waiting for server processing because there's no server involved. Your merged PDF is generated instantly, right on your machine.

## The Power of Local-First

This is local-first architecture in action. Traditional PDF tools follow a tired pattern: upload your sensitive documents to someone else's computer, wait for their servers to process them, then download the result. Along the way, your files sit on infrastructure you don't control, subject to policies you didn't write, vulnerable to breaches you'll never hear about.

We rejected that model entirely.

PDFJoin runs completely in your browser. It works offline. It works on a plane. It works in air-gapped environments. Once the page loads, you don't need an internet connection to merge your documents. That's how software should work.

## Why Free Forever?

PDFJoin exists to demonstrate what's possible when you build tools that respect users. We're not harvesting your documents for training data. We're not upselling you to a premium tier after three merges. We're not showing you ads based on the contents of your files.

The tool is lightweight, the infrastructure costs are minimal, and we believe basic document utilities should be accessible to everyone. So PDFJoin will remain free—no catches, no asterisks, no "free tier limits."

## Privacy You Don't Have to Trust

Most services ask you to trust their privacy policy. PDFJoin doesn't require trust because it's architecturally private. Your files physically cannot reach us. There's no server endpoint waiting to receive them. The code that merges your PDFs runs entirely in your browser's sandbox.

This isn't privacy by policy—it's privacy by design.

## Try It Now

Head over to [PDFJoin.org](https://pdfjoin.org), drop in some PDFs, and experience what local-first feels like. No account required. No email signup. No permissions to grant. Just a tool that does exactly what it says, entirely on your terms.

Welcome to the future of document utilities.
