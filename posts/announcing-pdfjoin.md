# Announcing PDFJoin

You're on a plane. No wifi. You need to merge two PDFs before landing. With most tools, you're stuck.

Not with [PDFJoin.org](https://pdfjoin.org).

## Your PDFs Never Leave Your Device

When you drag your PDFs into PDFJoin, they stay on your device. The entire merging process happens locally in your browser using WebAssembly. There's no upload, no server processing, no waiting. Your merged PDF is generated instantly, right on your machine.

## Privacy by Design

Most services ask you to trust their privacy policy. PDFJoin doesn't require trust because your files physically cannot reach us. There's no server endpoint waiting to receive them. The code that merges your PDFs runs entirely in your browser's sandbox.

This isn't privacy by policy: it's privacy by architecture.

## Try It Now

Head over to [PDFJoin.org](https://pdfjoin.org), drop in some PDFs, and see what local-first feels like. No account required. No email signup. Just a tool that does exactly what it says, entirely on your terms.
