# Hello World

Welcome to the Boba Matcha engineering blog! We're excited to share our journey building software that puts users first.

## Local-First Architecture

We believe your data should live on your device, not trapped in someone else's cloud. Local-first architecture means your apps work offline, sync seamlessly when connected, and keep you in control. It's how software should have always been built.

## Rust & WebAssembly

Rust gives us the power to write fast, safe code that compiles to WebAssembly. This means near-native performance right in your browser—no compromises. Complex computations that once required server round-trips now happen instantly on your machine.

## Edge Computing

The future is distributed, and Rust is the perfect fit. Its tiny binaries, zero runtime overhead, and memory safety make it ideal for edge deployments. Whether it's a Cloudflare Worker or an embedded device, Rust delivers consistent performance everywhere your code needs to run.

Stay tuned as we share projects, insights, and lessons learned along the way.
