# Hello World

We build software that solves local problems. We're starting with Florida.

## Why Florida

Florida has specific problems in real estate, legal, and government services. We'll tackle REtech, LegalTech, GovTech. We go where the problems are.

## Why Local First

Two reasons:

1. Privacy by default. Your data stays on your device.

2. Cheaper to experiment. No cloud costs scaling with usage means we can try more things without burning money.

When trying things is cheap, you try more things.

## On Releasing Software

All software is unfinished. The world changes too fast for anything to be done. We'd rather release something useful now than something perfect never.

## What We've Released

Products:
- [PDFJoin](https://pdfjoin.org): local-first PDF tools
- [FloridaContractorVerify](https://floridacontractorverify.com): contractor license lookup

Demos (experiments in local-first architecture with modern Rust):
- [Kanban Board](https://bobamatchasolutions.com/#/kanban): imports GitHub issues, exports to JSON, works offline
- [Flappy Bird](https://bobamatchasolutions.com/#/flappybird) and [Pac-Man](https://bobamatchasolutions.com/#/pacman): load once, play anywhere

The demos taught us the stack. Local-first in Rust is way easier now than it was in 2021.

We're not raising money. Stay tuned.
