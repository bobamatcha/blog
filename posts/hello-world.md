# Hello World

Welcome to the Boba Matcha engineering blog! We're excited to share our journey building software that puts users first.

## Local-First Architecture

We believe your data should live on your device, not trapped in someone else's cloud. Local-first architecture means your apps work offline, sync seamlessly when connected, and keep you in control. It's how software should have always been built.

## Rust & WebAssembly

Rust gives us the power to write fast, safe code that compiles to WebAssembly. This means near-native performance right in your browser—no compromises. Complex computations that once required server round-trips now happen instantly on your machine.

## Edge Computing

The future is distributed, and Rust is the perfect fit. Its tiny binaries, zero runtime overhead, and memory safety make it ideal for edge deployments. Whether it's a Cloudflare Worker or an embedded device, Rust delivers consistent performance everywhere your code needs to run.

Stay tuned as we share projects, insights, and lessons learned along the way.

## Experience Local-First in Action

We've built a collection of interactive prototypes that demonstrate the power and potential of local-first architecture. Each runs entirely in your browser with zero server dependencies—your data stays on your device, and everything works offline.

- **[Kanban Board](https://bobamatchasolutions.com/#/kanban)** — A fully-functional project management board that imports GitHub issues and exports to JSON. Manage your workflow without sending a single byte to the cloud.

- **[Flappy Bird](https://bobamatchasolutions.com/#/flappybird)** — The classic game, reimagined with local-first principles. Instant load times, no network latency, pure gameplay.

- **[Pac-Man](https://bobamatchasolutions.com/#/pacman)** — Navigate the maze in this browser-native recreation. All game state lives locally, proving that even real-time applications thrive without servers.

These prototypes represent our ongoing exploration of what's possible when you build software that respects user ownership and prioritizes performance. They're glimpses into the future we're building—one where powerful applications don't require giving up control of your data.
