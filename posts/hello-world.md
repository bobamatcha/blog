# Hello World

Welcome to the Boba Matcha engineering blog! We're a small team building software that works on a plane, in a coffee shop, or anywhere else. Once it loads in your browser, you're good to go.

## What We're Building

We believe your data should live on your device. Local first architecture means your apps work offline, sync when connected, and keep you in control. We're building three products with this philosophy:

- **A local-first Adobe competitor:** document editing that happens entirely in your browser ([PDFJoin](/posts/announcing-pdfjoin) is just the beginning)
- **A local-first DocuSign competitor:** sign and manage documents without uploading them anywhere
- **A local-first contract template website:** generate contracts securely on your device

## Try It Now

We've built some prototypes you can play with today:

- [Kanban Board](https://bobamatchasolutions.com/#/kanban): imports GitHub issues, exports to JSON, works offline
- [Flappy Bird](https://bobamatchasolutions.com/#/flappybird) and [Pac-Man](https://bobamatchasolutions.com/#/pacman): load once, play anywhere

## Zero-Knowledge Proving Systems (ZKPs): Verifiable Local-First

Local first is great, but how do you *prove* that an app actually works locally? Enter Zero-Knowledge Proving Systems (ZKPS).

ZKPS have a fascinating history. The concept emerged from cryptography research in the 1980s when Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff asked a wild question: can you prove you know something without revealing what you know? Turns out, yes. This breakthrough sat mostly in academia until blockchains brought ZKPS into practical use for privacy and scalability.

We're researching how to use ZKPS to *verify* our local first claims. Imagine a website that can cryptographically prove it never sent your data anywhere. That's the vision we're working toward. Not all features will be immediately verifiable, but we're building in that direction and excited to share what we learn along the way.

## Get Involved

We're not seeking funding at this time and won't prioritize open source until we've established a killer product! Right now we're experimenting with the latest in ML, Rust, and ZKPS. Stay tuned for projects, insights, and lessons learned.
